1. How do I approach designing software?

Testing is a crucial standard industry practice used to ensure all code functionalities are operational throughout the designing software. However, the first step when designing software is to understand the requirements and how to implement each assigned criterion. My approach also uses the method to work from top to bottom, prioritizing the needs and breaking each function into smaller subfunctions. The following step requires research to understand how to execute each function properly. Understanding each method makes it easier to break into subtasks to enhance the maintainability and reusability for future projects. Once the priorities are completed and tested, the following steps are ways to improve the project within the deadline and ensure all industry standards are implemented. 

2. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Many new concepts helped me develop design skills, including mesh creation, textures, lighting, and directional inputs. With mesh creation, I was able to form the base shapes that were required in the project. For example, using a torus, cylinder, and sphere, I was able to create a Christmas ornament. The textures were used to enhance the realism of the project to create the illusion of a lifelike scenery. By adding images such as all the colors of the Rubik's Cube to a box mesh, the photos felt as if one could pick up the object and hold it in their hands. The lighting helped make the scene's ambiance bring out the viewer's emotion. Adding darker lights creates a darker atmosphere to evoke an eerie feeling while looking at each object. Lastly, the directional inputs were implemented to allow viewers to wander through the stage as if entering a virtual reality. Viewers can see the different scales and renders created by enabling the camera view.

3. What design process did you follow for your project work?

The design process I followed in my project was first to gather and analyze each project requirement to determine what the end goal is. Once all the data was collected, I outlined what needed to be done while testing each functionality after every modification to ensure everything worked accordingly. Lastly, I would review any feedback provided to ensure all steps were evolving in the right direction.

4. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Gathering all necessary information can be applied in my future work to ensure each project is thoroughly understood. Although it can be time-consuming, I would instead proceed with cautionary steps rather than have assumptions that could lead to more significant mistakes. Another tactic I would implement in future work is to review feedback constantly. By obtaining feedback, I can ensure my self-growth is continuous and consistent.
